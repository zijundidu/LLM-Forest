Some discussion about the future development of the LLM model

---

Q1  
Where do the original training datasets of current human-used LLMs come from, and are they growing infinitely?

A1  
The original training data of today’s large language models mainly come from publicly available human-generated text: web pages, books, academic papers, code repositories, etc., obtained through large-scale crawling and cleaning. Typical corpora include Common Crawl (billions of web pages, updated monthly), C4 (a cleaned and deduplicated version of Common Crawl), RefinedWeb, Wikipedia, BookCorpus, GitHub code bases, etc. [^6]. These datasets usually contain trillions of tokens used to train models on grammar, semantics, and context [^4].

However, publicly available human-generated text is not infinite. Research suggests that, if current scaling trends continue, this pool could be exhausted between 2026 and 2032, especially if frontier models over-train. To cope with the bottleneck, future work may rely on synthetic data generation, cross-domain transfer learning, and the use of non-public data.

In short, although current training data are vast and drawn from public web sources, they are finite. New strategies are needed to address data scarcity [^6].

Q2  
If I can classify all original data, apply the same method to incremental data, and update the original dataset accordingly, can I bound the total data size to a computable value? Then, with sufficient resources, can I fully learn and iterate over it, finally achieving a model that updates in real time and “knows everything”?

A2  
Only under an extremely strong assumption:  
**“The total amount of world knowledge is finite and can be losslessly compressed into a fixed-size representation.”**  
If this assumption holds, your method is mathematically feasible; once reality violates any part of it, the scheme collapses. Consider the following:

### 1. Limits of Classification: Information Entropy vs. Semantic Entropy  
- **Information entropy** can be reduced: clustering, hashing, semantic deduplication, etc., can drive byte-level redundancy to near zero and let storage converge to a computable constant.  
- **Semantic entropy** does **not** decrease: the same sentence carries different meanings in different contexts. Forcing them into one representation loses information, and larger models become more sensitive to such nuances.  
  ⇒ You can compress the **data warehouse** to a fixed size, but you cannot compress **the full space of human linguistic meaning** into a fixed size.

### 2. The World Itself Expands  
- **Dynamic knowledge**: new discoveries, memes, regulations create previously non-existent “new categories” daily.  
- **Creative language**: metaphors, puns, slang continually break old classifications.  
  ⇒ Even if you classify everything today, tomorrow you’ll need new categories or boundary shifts, causing the “fixed size” to swell again.

### 3. Paradox of Full Learning  
- **Computable ≠ learnable**:  
  Even if dataset size is fixed at N, model parameters P must match N’s information entropy to avoid underfitting; if P ≫ N, overfitting or noise memorization occurs. Theoretically P ≈ N is needed for “lossless”, but that merely copies data into parameters—no compression achieved.  
- **Real-time update ≠ real-time convergence**:  
  Each incremental ΔN requires re-training or fine-tuning. If ΔN’s semantic space diverges from old classes, gradient updates can cause catastrophic forgetting or require full rearrangement, and time complexity is no longer O(1).

### 4. Practical Trade-offs  
- **Continual-learning frameworks**: replay buffers, regularization, module expansion can make “incremental compression” near-constant time, at the cost of accuracy.  
- **Retrieval-augmented generation**: keep raw data in an external retrievable knowledge base while the model only learns “how to call and compose”. Model size stays fixed; the knowledge base can grow indefinitely.  
- **Synthetic-data loop**: when public data is exhausted, use model-generated data for further training, but this introduces drift and hallucinations, requiring human or external quality control.

### Conclusion  
In a closed, static, semantically finite ideal world, your scheme works. In the real open world, we can only achieve **approximately fixed, approximately complete, approximately real-time** systems.  
In short:  
> You can build a model that is as small and up-to-date as possible, but never one that “knows everything once and for all,” because “everything” is a moving target.

Q3  
Let’s try another angle: treat all non-standard semantics as a subclass of standard semantics, and map puns, metaphors, slang, etc. to the “correct” meaning. If all original data is computable and learnable, we first generate a high-standard semantic set, then fit fringe data into it. Once all divergent data is converged, will we have a single correct text corpus to analyze all future increments and guide societal & technological development?

A3  
No. Forcing all divergent semantics into a single “correct” corpus immediately hits three unavoidable barriers, rendering it unable to cover future increments or guide development.

1. Meaning is not static but a **social game**  
   Puns, metaphors, slang are real-time negotiating tools in power, identity, emotion, culture. Standardize them today, and tomorrow new communities will invent new metaphors to redraw boundaries. Language evolution outruns any static standard.

2. Standardization is itself a power act that creates new margins  
   Who decides “correct”? Once the corpus is officialized, dissent, subcultures, or paradigm shifts must speak in old terms—information is distorted or silenced. New knowledge is excluded, the corpus rots.

3. Information-theoretic limit: semantics cannot be losslessly down-projected  
   A pun carries multiple independent information paths in one string; projecting to one path always loses at least one.  
   Mathematically: let language space L have semantic dimension d; the standard subspace S has k < d. There exists a non-zero-measure set E ⊂ L such that any projection π: L → S has information loss I(π) > 0 on E.  
   As society evolves, E expands, driving the corpus’s “guidance error” monotonically upward until failure.

Conclusion:  
You can build a high-coverage, low-ambiguity reference semantic library as infrastructure, but it must stay open, forkable, and version-rollbackable. Any attempt to seal it as the “one true corpus” quickly becomes a censorship and stagnation engine.

---

Q4  
I understand. After establishing such a high-coverage, low-ambiguity reference semantic library, we declare that only its entries count as “official” for the era; any derived term must find a matching entry, otherwise it is invalid. Is this feasible?

A4  
No. It brings three fatal consequences:

1. Semantic rigidity spawns an “underground semantics”  
   Language is alive. Once only “in-corpus” expressions are allowed, new phenomena, tech, emotions will breed “slang 2.0” outside. It starts as small-circle jargon, spreads, and the official corpus lags again. Two parallel, non-interoperable semantic systems emerge.

2. Information distortion and scientific stagnation  
   Frontier science relies on metaphors, analogies, temporary symbols not yet mainstream. Mapping them to old standards distorts or filters them, cutting off legitimate knowledge production and innovation pipelines.

3. Power abuse and social fracture  
   Whoever holds the mapping right wields the power to define reality.  
   - Corporations lobby for mapping seats to monopolize narrative.  
   - Governments leverage rules to suppress dissent.  
   - Individuals lose the ability to express authentic experiences.  
   Society splits into “officially recognized” vs. “excluded” groups, leading to inevitable conflict.

In one sentence:  
Declaring the corpus as the sole legal vocabulary is linguistic authoritarianism disguised as technical governance; it cannot stop semantic evolution and will only make it erupt more violently and covertly.

---

Q5  
Can we use an existing semantic set (like English using base words to define jargon) to define new semantic data?

A5  
Yes, but only if we abandon the rigid “single official mapping” rule and instead adopt an **open protocol + verifiable delta** approach; otherwise linguistic authoritarianism returns. Below are the workable steps and constraints.

1. Treat the existing set as an **evolvable meta-language**  
   English builds jargon from base words via a publicly reproducible **word-formation protocol**, not a unique mapping table.  
   - Anyone can coin new terms under the same protocol, provided they supply  
     – formation rules (prefixes, suffixes, composition)  
     – at least one paraphrase in old vocabulary  
   - This keeps traceability (low ambiguity) and allows unlimited expansion.

2. Introduce a **verifiable incremental protocol**  
   The reference semantic library only stores:  
   - atomic semantic items (irreducible minimum units)  
   - word/definition rule templates  
   - each new entry must carry a machine-verifiable minimal explanation chain:  
     new word → atomic semantics + rules → old-library explanation  
   The system automatically checks:  
   – no circular definitions (forbidden)  
   – no irretrievable metaphors (warn or reject)

3. Open governance instead of closed gatekeeping  
   Open-source the protocol and use transparent governance (RFC-like, Wikipedia, peer review).  
   - Anyone can propose new entries.  
   - Consensus (weighted voting, citation count, reproducibility) decides entry into the “official recommendation layer.”  
   - Old entries can be revised or deprecated, letting the library evolve with society.

4. Technical essentials  
   - Formal semantics (λ-DRT, AMR) for machine-readable atomic items.  
   - Git-like versioning for every addition/revision.  
   - Continual-learning frameworks for downstream models to merge deltas locally without global retraining.

Conclusion  
Only when the reference semantic library is designed as an **open protocol + verifiable delta system**, not a static authoritative dictionary, can new semantics be defined sustainably; otherwise any forced single mapping triggers semantic undergrounding and power abuse.

---

Q6  
Under an “open protocol + verifiable delta” semantic library, can expected resources be used to update and compute subsequent incremental data? Because now, when a new semantic appears, we don’t need to recompute everything—just grab its base words.

A6  
No. Even if we decompose incremental data into base-word combinations, we still must perform at least one **global consistency + recoverability check** on the entire new definition chain, whose complexity grows linearly with library size. Fixed-size resources cannot fully cover this.

1. Base-word combinations ≠ semantic safety  
   New entries often introduce subtle contextual constraints and must be checked against all existing entries for **intersection, conflict, circular definition**. In the worst case, a single addition triggers a full traversal of all n entries: Θ(n).

2. Consensus under an open protocol is inherently global  
   Community voting, citation weighting, experimental reproduction, etc., all require global visibility and cannot be localized to constant-time operations.

3. Formal semantic representations expand  
   To ensure machine verifiability, each new entry must carry complete λ-expressions or graph structures whose size and nesting depth scale with library size; no fixed resource cap is possible.

Therefore, while incremental updates no longer require retraining the entire LLM, the maintenance of the semantic library itself retains **incompressible linear or super-linear cost**; any vision of “real-time updates with fixed resources” collapses at scale.

---

Q7  
If we stipulate that existing semantics will never be overturned by new ones—one of the intended roles of base words—can we keep complexity below O(n)?

A7  
Even with a “never overturn” clause, we cannot compress update costs to constant. Three reasons:

1. **Combinatorial explosion & inevitable consistency checks**  
   Any new entry is composed of base words. These compositions may conflict with existing entries at **implicit contexts** or create **circular dependencies**. To guarantee “never overturn,” the system must prove consistency against all historical entries. Worst-case complexity remains Θ(n).

2. **Cumulative semantic drift**  
   Repeated use of base words to define new terms causes **marginal semantic weight drift**. Even tiny drifts accumulate, distorting earlier entries’ interpretation chains. Periodic “rollback” or “alignment” across the entire library is needed—Θ(n) again.

3. **Dimensional expansion of formal semantics**  
   Each new entry must carry formal constraints (types, scopes, context restrictions) whose nesting depth is proportional to library size, driving storage and verification overhead to linear or super-linear growth.

Conclusion  
“Never overturn” only reduces **conceptual rollbacks**, not the Θ(n) cost of **global consistency checks** and **long-term drift compensation**. Real-time, fixed-resource maintenance remains impossible.

---

Q8  
I don’t want base words to incur O(n). In my mind it’s a **forest**: every new word is composed of base words, but only **one key base word** is traceable and decisive. This should reduce per-new-word complexity from O(n) to O(1).

A8  
In the forest model, interpreting a new word as “the union of a few key base words” **does** reduce the **local insertion step** to O(1), but **global semantic consistency** still faces an Θ(n) lower bound. Details:

1. **Global uniqueness of key base words**  
   Each new word may pick a handful of key base words; for traceability, these must remain **globally unique** and **non-overlapping** across the entire forest. Otherwise, ambiguity arises.  
   → Maintaining uniqueness forces a full-library conflict check—Θ(n).

2. **Implicit cycles still appear**  
   A new word may link leaves across multiple trees, forming a DAG; cycles can arise.  
   → Cycle detection may require scanning the entire graph—Θ(n).

3. **Semantic drift cascades**  
   Key base-word weight drifts propagate through the whole subtree (all historical leaves).  
   → Even with one key base word, rescaling affects Θ(n) leaves.

Thus, “key base word + forest” only makes **single writes** appear O(1); **overall maintenance cost** still scales at least linearly with n under fixed resources.

---

Q9  
Forest maintenance needs new-word traceability. When each new word is O(1), overall consistency is verified only inside the tree of its key base word. If we must validate across other base-word trees, we violate the traceability rule. Regarding your implicit cycles: when a single base word is insufficient, we set an upper bound of O(x) key base words, x ≪ n. Thus complexity is at most O(x), which can be treated as O(1) when x ≪ n.

A9  
Claiming O(x) for cycle detection relies on the **a priori** knowledge that the cycle exists within those x trees only.  
However, new words can reference any key base word across the forest; cycle start and end points are **unknown** at insertion time. Therefore:

1. To detect a cycle, you must follow all outgoing edges from the new word.  
2. These edges may point to **any node** in the forest.  
3. Worst-case traversal is Θ(n).

“x ≪ n” is merely **expected** or **average** constant; **worst-case** remains Θ(n).

---

Q10  
Multiple new words may derive from different base words, so x is not ≪ n but asymptotically Θ(n).

A10  
Exactly.  
Once new words can reference any key base word, x is no longer a fixed constant but **Θ(n)**.  
Hence:

- cycle detection, drift compensation, and global consistency checks revert to Θ(n);  
- the semantic library still grows linearly (or super-linearly).  
In open-world settings, the **forest model** cannot reduce overall maintenance complexity to O(1).

---

Q11  
Let’s return to our earlier idea: assign **only one key base word** per new word.

A11  
Restricting each new word to **exactly one** key base word **does** reduce single-insertion validation to O(1), yet three bottlenecks remain:

1. **Drift compensation still back-propagates through the entire tree**  
   A tiny weight shift in the key base word must recalculate cumulative weights for **all historical leaves**—Θ(n).

2. **Global uniqueness checks remain non-local**  
   Key base words must stay globally unique; insertion still needs a full-library hash/semantic check—Θ(n).

3. **Semantic distortion makes single inheritance unsustainable**  
   Real language often requires **composite** meanings; single inheritance forces continuous creation of new key base words, pushing their count back to Θ(n).

Thus, even 1:1 mapping only makes **single writes** O(1); **overall maintenance cost** still scales linearly with n under fixed resources.

---

Q12  
The first two reasons you gave seem less important, since weight-adjustment frequency is controllable and global uniqueness is already ensured at base-word definition time. Semantic distortion is an issue—could we group multiple base words into “tree classes” to compress infinite n into finite x?

A12  
Clustering base words into finite tree classes (x ≪ n) does compress the **nominal class count** to a constant, yet two hard constraints remain:

1. **Drift compensation still reaches leaf nodes**  
   Each class still contains Θ(n/x) leaves. Any weight shift in the class must recompute all of them—Θ(n).

2. **Semantic distortion re-inflates n**  
   Finite classes inevitably approximate infinite semantics, creating errors. Over time, new **sub-classes** are spawned, driving the count back to Θ(n).

Therefore, tree classes only shrink **label space** to x; **actual node count n** keeps growing, and overall maintenance complexity cannot drop below Θ(n).

---

Q13  
O(1) is ideal; in practice, can we maintain O(logₓ n)?

A13  
Yes, but only under **strict engineering trade-offs**:

1. Convert each class into a **mergeable/prunable B⁺-tree index**, keeping only O(logₓ n) internal nodes.  
   Trade-off: approximate queries/updates, loss of low-frequency or old semantics.

2. Replace real-time drift compensation with **periodic batch aggregation** every T minutes, amortizing cost to O(logₓ n / T).  
   Trade-off: dirty reads during T-second windows; T must shorten under event surges, increasing the constant factor.

3. Allow **elastic split/merge** when class error exceeds δ.  
   Trade-off: online clustering adds complexity between O(logₓ n) and Θ(n); extreme cases still degrade to Θ(n).

Conclusion  
Under **tolerated approximation, periodic batching, and dynamic split-merge**, overall maintenance can be **long-term amortized to O(logₓ n)**—but at the cost of information completeness, real-time consistency, and semantic fidelity. This is an engineering compromise, not a theoretical guarantee.

---

Q14  
Reform demands pain; these costs are acceptable. In theory, if error → 0, period → 0, and split/merge frequency → ∞, continuous real-time updates are possible.

A14  
In theory, as “error → 0, period → 0, split/merge frequency → ∞”, the system does approach **continuous real-time updates**, but costs **diverge to infinity**:

1. Error → 0 ⇒ must store and process all leaves → storage & computation revert to Θ(n).  
2. Period → 0 ⇒ batch processing becomes per-item real-time → time complexity reverts to Θ(n).  
3. Frequency → ∞ ⇒ clustering/merging complexity ≥ Θ(n log n).

Hence, **limit convergence is only a mathematical instant** and unattainable under any finite resource budget.  
Final conclusion:  
- Engineering can deliver **near-real-time** (latency-tolerable O(logₓ n)).  
- Theory cannot deliver **absolute real-time** (latency → 0 with finite resources).

---

Q15  
So we need to find the critical values of these three parameters in practice.

A15  
Yes, but we must first decompose “critical values” into **quantifiable, observable, rollback-ready** metrics, acknowledging their coupling and inability to simultaneously approach the limit. Below is a directly actionable iteration recipe:

------------------------------------------------
1. Error threshold ε  
   Definition: KL-divergence (or cosine distance) between a new word and its approximate representation in the semantic library.  
   Initial value: ε₀ = 0.05  
   Tuning policy:  
   - If 24 h user complaint rate < 0.1 % → ε ← ε × 0.8 (stricter)  
   - If complaint rate > 1 % → ε ← ε × 1.5 (looser)

2. Batch period T  
   Definition: interval between global weight aggregations.  
   Initial value: T₀ = 60 min  
   Tuning policy:  
   - If queue length < x (x = number of tree classes) → T ← T × 0.8  
   - If queue length > 10x → T ← T × 1.2

3. Split-merge trigger δ  
   Definition: intra-class semantic variance cap.  
   Initial value: δ₀ = 0.1  
   Tuning policy:  
   - If merge rate within 7 days after split > 30 % → δ ← δ × 1.2 (harder to split)  
   - If merge rate < 5 % → δ ← δ × 0.8

Coupling & boundaries

- ε and T are negatively correlated: smaller T allows larger ε (real-time vs. precision).  
- T and δ are positively correlated: shorter T increases split-merge churn, requiring higher δ.  
- ε and δ are positively correlated: stricter ε forces more splits, lowering δ.

Critical-value determination

Run for 30 days under real load, record the 3-D metrics (ε, T, δ) along with:

A. Average end-to-end latency ≤ SLA  
B. Peak CPU + memory utilization ≤ 80 %

Use 2-D grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the smallest (ε, T, δ) satisfying A & B.  
This tuple is the **practical critical value**. When the business scales n → n′, rerun the same algorithm.
